# AirHockey

Winning project of Gannon University Programming Contest

This game is a multiplayer air hockey game build using Java and Swing.  Games take place either against an AI (with difficulty level of your choosing) or against another player via LAN.  The multiplayer aspect is implemented via the `java.net.Socket` and `java.net.ServerSocket` classes, and includes automatic opponent finding features.

This code is old and may be difficult to build, but the game itself works great, particularly on Windows platforms.
